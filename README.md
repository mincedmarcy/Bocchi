# The Strange and Borderline Horrific Implications of the _Girls Und Panzer_ Lore
_Girls Und Panzer_, an anime releasing in 2012 under the direction of Tsutomu Mizushima, is the sort of beautiful abomination of a show that one might call the pinnacle of the medium's evolution. At its heart, the series (which will, from here on out, be referred to as _GuP_) revolves around middle school girls doing what middle school girls do best: that is, tactically fighting each other for sport. Instead of schools taking pride in their curriculum or, say, their soccer or basketball team, schools in the _GuP_ universe take pride in their brilliant Sensha-dō teams; Sensha-dō, as we all know, is the ancient, girls-only martial art form revolving around the maintenence and utilization of World War I and II era tanks as a vessel for improving your womenhood. _Literal tanks_, by the way - the series isn't one for the subtleties of metaphors, no, these are REAL tanks: the main character and her best friends are fully capable (and actually rather skilled, for the show's standards) of operating and deploying a 1930s German Panzer IV.

<sup> Pictured above is the main character, Miho Nishizumi, along with her friends inside of their Panzer IV, which they've endearingly plastered an anglerfish symbol over - the mark of her team. </sup>

Sensha-dō, as brought up previously, is a pre-WWII sport made for women to improve many attributes: in particular, self-esteem, citizenship, and motherly traits: these are, of course, rather strange traits to reduce an entire women's being to, but the genuine, in universe Sensha-dō propoganda film these blurbs were pulled from was created in 1939, at the peak of the Second World War. I can't delve deep into the fact that genuine war propoganda is being fed to classes fulled of 14-year old girls (and yes, this is a _mandatory_ tape to view for, atleast, the protagonist's school), as, even on the surface, the world of _GuP_ is so comically absurd, and yet so, so beautiful.

And I _do mean_ on the surface, by the way. These "schools" I have been mentioning - the great education system that makes it so that it is easier for students to fire a tank then pass basic algebra - all take place on **aircraft-carrier-esque floating cities**, the size of which are in no way feasible, and are such behemoths that, when docked, tower over the ports meant to house them:

<sup> The main character's school of choice, Oorai Girls' Academy, is on the _smaller_ end of these "school ships". </sup>

These ships are not only massive, but populated: Oorai's Academy alone (which, by the way, is the _entire_ ship) houses over 30,000 people, which is a population that is higher than that of four countries. This 30,000 isn't just comprised of middle-school girls, of course: many (but not all) of the students' families live aboard the ship, as well as the teachers and staff, and the 9 to 5s who work in grocers, convenience stores, ice cream shops, restaraunts, and basically everything else a 14-15 year old girl might need after a tiring day of manuevering a tank for a grade. You might have noticed that there was one key group of people that were _not_ on the list of residents: where do the people who manage the ship live? Don't you fret, my buddy old pal, because they're in that list.

They're the 14-15 year old girls.

## Education and Life on a School Ship

For Oorai's Academy (The main character's School Ship), the education system is broken down into factions, with each different sector of education teaching entirely different and seperate things. Those divisions are as follows:
- Standard Education
- Naval Education
- Engineering
- Intelligence
- Fashion Design
- Nutritional Science
- Fisheries Management
- Agricultural Science
There are other divisions mentioned (such as Meterology), but they are not offered by the main character's school. Another thing to note is that these divisions are _mutually_ exclusive: if you're in one division, you will _not_ learn another (with a few exceptions). This means that someone learning, say, how to design clothes for the hottest trends, or how to fish efficiently and effectively, would not learn World History, Languages, or Math, all of which are offered under Standard Education; this pathway is also the one which offers the Sensha-dō sport.

As for those who run the ship, it is those in the Naval Educations, Engineering, and (presumably) the Intelligence divisions: Naval Educations keep the boat running, moving, and in tip-top shape, while Engineering provides power to the entire cities' worth of technology, lighting, and other such fixtures. If this sounds like child labor, that is because it _literally_ is: instead of paying for tuitions, students can opt for taking _these_ divisions instead, working a full 8 hour shift on top of classes, studying, homework, and generally being a 14-15 year old girl. The entire backbone of the ship is literally built off of draining the lives of 15 year old children, and if *that* isn't a perfect example of the education system, well.. This is a school project, so I won't say too much!!
